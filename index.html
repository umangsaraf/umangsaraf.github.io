                I've always considered myself to be a Chritsian Bale fan and 
                some of my favorite movies are  Dark Knight Rises, The prestige and The Dark Knight. But upon looking at 
                his <i>IMDB</i> page, I noticed that he had acted in over 52 movies. 
                I was really curious about 
                the other movies christaian bale acted in.  A lot of question came to my mind like - 
    
            <ul>
                <li> What other kind of movies did christaon bale act in</li>
                <li> Does he act in a diverse type of films</li>
                <li>What kind of movies is he critically acclaimed for?</li>
                <li>Which movies did he win an award for? </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        </p> 
        To begin this task I had to collect all information about the actor and the movies he acted in. 
        I parsed the actors page to got the name of the movies and the link to access the page. Once I 
        got the links of all the movies Christian bale acted in, I parsed through all of them and collected meta 
        data about the movie. I skipped all movies that had less than a 1000 reviews which removed all the small independent
        films
        and commercials he acted in. For each movie I collected some meta data like ratings, keywords, number of reviews etc.
        It outputted a datafarame with 40 movies. </br>

        </p>

        <p>
                I was curious what his words defined his movies best. IMDB had data for the top keywords that defined a movie.
                For each movie I took the top 50% best keywords and plotted a word cloud for it.
                <p style="text-align:center;">You can hover over the words to look at the occurrence of each keyword</p>

        <div id="container" ></div>
       
        <p>
            We see words like <strong>death</strong>, <b>murder</b>, <b>Violence</b> have the highest occurace. This aligns with kind of movies Christian Bale acts in 
            which are mostly thriller and action based. We also see keywords like <b>husband-wife relationship</b> and <b>father-son
                    relationship</b>  which implies he has acted in a lot of drama movies. ALso, the word <b>BARE CHESTED MALE</b> 
             made it. Christain bale is known for his shirtless takes in movies.

        </p>

        <p>
            Next I wanted to see what are the most popular movies Bale acted based on the Genre. I defined 
            popularity as the number of votes a movie received. Even if a movie had a low rating but a large number 
            of reviews it will still be considered popular. </br>
            <p style="text-align:center;">You can Hover over the bubble to look at the movie name and number of reviews </p>
        </p>


        <div id="container2" ></div>
    </br>

    <p>
        We see that Christian Bale acted in mostly Action and Drama based movies. Some of his most poular movies 
        are <b>The Batman Triology</b>, <b>Prestige</b> and <b>American Psycho</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
       Next I want to look at the accomplishments of Bale i.e the awards he won over the years.

        <p>
            Seens like christian Bale did really well in the Movies the Fighter, getting him 3 awards over the span of three years. 
            He also won his one and only oscar for the movie Fighter in 2011.
